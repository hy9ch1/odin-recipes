    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Ukranian borscht</strong> is a hearty soup of beef and a variety of vegetables in which root vegetables and cabbage predominate, 
        and the soup takes its characteristic deep red colour from beets.

        <li>When the meat is ready, remove it from the broth.</li>
        <li>Prepare the cabbage I usually don't slice it—instead, I cut it in squares; to do it, cut off the stem and start 
            slicing the cabbage lengthwise, and then slice it crosswise to make quarter-rounds. 
            Add sliced ​​potatoes and cabbage to the broth and cook.</li>

            and leave to simmer on the low-medium heat until ready (watch so it doesn't burn).</li>
